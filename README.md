# WeatherTop

An MVC-based Node/[Express](https://expressjs.com/) web app for managing WeatherTop Inc. weather stations. Users can register, log in, add/delete stations and readings, update account settings, as well as view readings and station analytics. Users can also auto-generate readings using the [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/) API, view [Frappe charts](https://frappe.io/charts) displaying weekly forecasts, and a [Leaflet map](https://leafletjs.com/) displaying markers for each station. Styled using [Fomantic-UI](https://fomantic-ui.com/) and deployed on [Glitch](https://www.glitch.com/).

This web app was created as part of an assignment for SETU's Computer Science HDip course. You can [visit the 
deployed app here](https://the-return-of-weathertop.glitch.me).
